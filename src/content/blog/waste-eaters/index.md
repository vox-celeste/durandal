cain maddox's *Waste Eaters* is a short and punchy work of IF. It doesn't overplay its hand, focusing instead on the bittersweetness of having accomplished a noble goal for which the world will neither remember nor thank you.  

Many years ago, scientists and dreamers decided there was nothing for the polluted earth but to modify human volunteers into monstrous biological sin-eaters. The game is a portrait of the last of the waste eaters on the day they consume the last drop of humanity's biochemical sin.

The music and visual cues are minimalistic and effective. The limited palette evokes the blaring primary colours of hazard symbols while steering in a more autumnal direction, in keeping with its themes of decay and return to the earth. 

*Waste Eaters* scratched my itch for the melancholy and downbeat side of solarpunk. Maybe the real wish fulfillment fantasy was the idea that radicals could see the day of their own obsolescence?
